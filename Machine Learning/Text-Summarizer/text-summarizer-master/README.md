### Understand Text Summarization and create your own summarizer in python

Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning.

Impact
Summarization systems often have additional evidence they can utilize in order to specify the most important topics of document(s). For example, when summarizing blogs, there are discussions or comments coming after the blog post that are good sources of information to determine which parts of the blog are critical and interesting.

In scientific paper summarization, there is a considerable amount of information such as cited papers and conference information which can be leveraged to identify important sentences in the original paper.
